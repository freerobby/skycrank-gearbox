skycrank-gearbox:
----------------
A cluster controlled by a provisioner node fpr deploys, etc. using Chef
Metal.

Ultimately a failed (at least for now :) experiment.  See Post Mortem section
for details.

Pre-Requisites:
---------------

* A recent version of Ruby - at least 1.9.X (I haven't exhaustively tested gem
versions - I'm using Ruby 2.1.0)
* The Bundler gem installed
* Vagrant - http://www.vagrantup.com
* ChefDK from Opscode - http://downloads.getchef.com/chef-dk/



What Works:
-----------


Instructions on starting the cluster:
-------------------------------------

Check this Git repository out of github, cd into the skycrank-gearbox directory,
and run 'bundle install' to fetch all the requisite gems.

In vagrant_skycrank_cluster.rb, Edit the line that reads
```vagrant_cluster '/Users/cpatti/Vagrants'``` 
to reflect an empty dir on your machine where the cluster VMs can reside.



Starting the Cluster:
---------------------

Type ```bundle exec chef-client -z vagrant_skycrank_cluster.rb```

You should see a bunch of output similar to the following:

```

What Doesn't Work:
------------------

The cluster orchestration piece! As detailed in his excellent ChefConf 2014
tech talk by the author, the idea of chef metal is to build a cluster, and then
be able to run recipes on cluster nodes using the ```metal```  command
(Like, say, to run deploys?) Just what the doctor ordered, right? Only metal is
Alpha, and while people are using it in production, I couldn't get this to work.


Post-Mortem:
------------

My vision - chef-metal managing the cluster, with skycrank-gearbox being the
'provisioner node' and coordinating deploys from there using the chef-metal
metal command.

I even wrote the little Sinatra HTTP API app to take deploy requests:

https://github.com/feoh/skycrank-control-panel

First off, I couldn't get metal itself to build the cluster.  A Twitter
exchange with the author revealed that this critical bug was fixed in
the master branch, so at least I got that far and got the cluster up and
running.

Secondly (and this is the stake in the heart of this idea) - I can't under
any circumstances get the metal command itself to work - the lynch pin of
the operation! :) The idea was to have the skycrank gearbox node bring up
the cluster and then run invocations like 
```metal execute recipe[skycrank-gearbox::deploy]``` from inside the little
Sinatra app when the appropriate HTTP requests come in.


What I Would Do Differently:
----------------------------

Not using Alpha technology would be a good start, even if others have had success
running it in production :) Or, if I'd decided to do so initially, once I ran
across the first show stopper bug (unable to build the cluster) I should have cut
my losses and moved on.

I also think I under-estimated the time it would take to come up to speed with
using chef in a chef-server environment.  Building servers with chef-solo, which
is where all my chef experience currently lies, vastly simplifies the developer
surface area for working with chef, at the expense of some really awesome features.

I had been relying on the chef-metal approach with its local mode chef-zero 
compatability to allow me to deliver a solution in a very constrained period of
time, and as stated above, that didn't pan out.
